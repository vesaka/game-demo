# game-demo
This repository contains my first attemp to create any game. No matter the platform. 
I'd like to give credit to: 
  1. The Pixi.js engine - as a start on game development quest, the big fish for web browser games is may be the most appropriate choice because of the community and the support.
  2. The Big.js library - having performance issues with Math.sqrt function made me search for an alternative. And that library was the best I got so far. 
  Demo of the game can be found on the link bellow:

  Enjoy it:
  
Note - The game will get more features in the future. Oh, and title as well.
