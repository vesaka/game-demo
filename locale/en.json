Whenever you reach the last 30th circle, victory is yours.\nNot all of circle numbers are visible. Only the current goal and last three visited circles are visible.\nPointer leaves a trail behind. This will disappear in 5 turns.\nFollowing mistakes should be prevented:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe pointer must not cross or hit its own trail\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe pointer should not hit any other circle then the current goal.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe boundaries of the world (game screen) must not be hit.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe pointer stamina to run out before you reach the current goal.\n\nIf such mistake occurs one Health Point is taken and the pointer will be returned to start position of current turn.The game will end either with all 30 circles cleared or with Health Point reduced to 0.\n\n\nHAVE FUN"
